A Rust-native MTG engine compiling to native and WASM, powering a Tauri desktop app, browser PWA, and WebSocket multiplayer. Implements comprehensive MTG rules using functional architecture — pure reducers, discriminated unions, and immutable state with structural sharing — with an Arena-quality React/TypeScript UI.

## Story

I'm Matt — a millennial software engineer who loves Magic. My six-year-old son asks me to play with him all the time, but the real game is just too complicated for a kid his age.

So I built [Alchemy](https://matthewevans.github.io/alchemy) ([source](https://github.com/matthewevans/alchemy)) — a simplified, kid-friendly version of MTG we could play together on our iPads. Fewer keywords, no lands, energy that builds each turn, and an adaptive learning mode where he solves math problems for combat bonuses. I had a working version in a single afternoon and fleshed it out over the following week.

After that I wanted to see how far I could push it — a real MTG rules engine in Rust, compiling to WASM, with the same React frontend so the whole thing runs in a browser. This whole project went from nothing to where it is now in a matter of weeks.

I'm not trying to make money off this. There are no ads. I'm just a dude who likes Magic.

## Features

- **Rules engine** — Turns, priority, stack, combat, state-based actions, layers, triggers, replacement effects
- **34,300+ cards** — Parsed from MTGJSON with format support (Commander, Modern, Pioneer, Standard, and more)
- **AI opponent** — Per-card decision logic, game tree search, and evaluation heuristics
- **Game UI** — Battlefield, hand, stack, targeting overlays, mana payment, animations, and ambient audio
- **Multiplayer** — WebSocket server with hidden information, lobby system, and WebRTC peer-to-peer
- **Metagame feeds** — Automated scraping of top decks from MTGGoldfish, updated daily
- **Deck builder** — Card search, visual builder, and `.dck`/`.dec` import
- **Cross-platform** — Tauri desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), browser PWA, and tablet
- **Card images** — Scryfall integration with IndexedDB caching

## Contribute a Card with Your LLM

Thousands of cards are still unimplemented. If you use Claude Code, Codex CLI, or a similar agent, you can "lend your LLM" an hour and ship a real PR — **even if you don't have a Rust toolchain**. The LLM does all the work; you just paste a prompt.

Hand this to your LLM:

```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phase-rs/phase/main/docs/AI-CONTRIBUTOR.md
and follow it end-to-end to implement {a card I name, or pick one for me}.
Use medium thinking. Don't stop for my input. Open a PR when done.
```

Full procedure, two tracks (developer / non-developer), and copy-paste prompts for LLM UIs without web fetch: [docs/AI-CONTRIBUTOR.md](docs/AI-CONTRIBUTOR.md).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
- wasm32 target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` (Windows: see below)
- wasm-bindgen-cli: `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli@0.2.114`
- wasm-opt (optional): `brew install binaryen` or `apt install binaryen`
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/): `npm i -g pnpm`

#### Windows

`rustup` on Windows defaults to the GNU toolchain, which requires `dlltool.exe` and fails with _"error calling dlltool 'dlltool.exe': program not found"_. You need [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with the **Desktop development with C++** workload, then switch to the MSVC host:

```powershell
rustup set default-host x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup toolchain install nightly --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Verify with `rustup show active-toolchain` — it should end in `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.

The setup scripts also require `jq` and `curl`, which are not installed by default on Windows. Install them before running `./scripts/setup.sh`:

```powershell
winget install jqlang.jq
winget install curl.curl   # skip if curl is already on your PATH
```

Open a new terminal after installing so the updated PATH takes effect.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phase-rs/phase && cd phase
./scripts/setup.sh     # Downloads card data, builds WASM, installs deps
cd client && pnpm dev  # Start dev server at localhost:5173
```

### Manual Steps

```bash
./scripts/gen-card-data.sh            # generate card-data.json
./scripts/build-wasm.sh               # Build WASM bindings
cd client && pnpm install && pnpm dev # Start frontend
```

## Architecture

### Rust Workspace (`crates/`)

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `engine` | Core rules engine: types, game logic, parser, card database |
| `phase-ai` | AI opponent: evaluation, legal actions, search |
| `engine-wasm` | WASM bindings via wasm-bindgen + tsify |
| `server-core` | Server-side game session management |
| `phase-server` | Axum WebSocket server for multiplayer |
| `feed-scraper` | Metagame deck scraper (MTGGoldfish) |

Dependency flow: `engine` <- `phase-ai` <- `engine-wasm` / `server-core` <- `phase-server` (feed-scraper is standalone)

### Frontend (`client/`)

React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Zustand + Framer Motion + Vite

Transport-agnostic `EngineAdapter` interface with multiple implementations:
- **WasmAdapter** — Direct WASM calls (browser/PWA)
- **TauriAdapter** — Tauri IPC (desktop)
- **WebSocketAdapter** — WebSocket (multiplayer)
- **P2PHostAdapter / P2PGuestAdapter** — WebRTC peer-to-peer via PeerJS

### Design Principles

- **Pure reducers** — `apply(state, action) -> ActionResult` with no mutation
- **Discriminated unions** — Rust enums serialize to tagged TS unions via serde + tsify
- **Structural sharing** — Immutable state via rpds persistent data structures

## Development

### Build Commands

> **Tip:** If you're running Tilt (`tilt up`), prefer `./scripts/tilt-wait.sh <resource>` over the direct cargo/pnpm equivalents — Tilt continuously rebuilds in the background and `tilt-wait.sh` blocks only until the relevant resource settles, avoiding target-lock contention. When Tilt is **not** running, fall back to the commands below. See `CLAUDE.md` § "Canonical verification pattern" for the conditional template used by agents and skills.

```bash
# Rust (uses cargo-nextest for test execution)
cargo test-all                             # Run all tests (nextest)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # Lint
cargo fmt --all -- --check                 # Format check

# WASM
./scripts/build-wasm.sh                    # Build WASM (release)
./scripts/build-wasm.sh debug              # Build WASM (debug)

# Frontend
cd client
pnpm install                               # Install dependencies
pnpm dev                                   # Vite dev server
pnpm build                                 # TypeScript check + Vite build
pnpm lint                                  # ESLint
pnpm test                                  # Vitest
```

### Cargo Aliases

```
cargo test-all          # Run all tests (nextest)
cargo clippy-strict     # Lint with -D warnings
cargo export-cards      # Run card data exporter
cargo coverage          # Card support coverage report
cargo wasm              # Build WASM (debug)
cargo wasm-release      # Build WASM (release)
cargo serve             # Run multiplayer server
cargo scrape-feeds      # Scrape metagame feeds
```
