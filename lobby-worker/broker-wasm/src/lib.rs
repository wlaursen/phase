//! wasm-bindgen bindings exposing the `lobby-broker` core to the Cloudflare
//! Durable Object shell (`lobby-worker/src/lobby-do.ts`).
//!
//! Mirrors the `engine` -> `engine-wasm` pattern: the pure broker lives in
//! `lobby-broker`; this crate is the thin transport boundary that (de)serializes
//! across the JS/WASM line and injects the runtime `BrokerEnv`. All protocol
//! parsing and dispatch stays in Rust — the TS shell only forwards raw frames
//! and interprets the returned `Outbound` side effects.
//!
//! State model: a hibernated DO loses memory, so the shell snapshots the whole
//! broker to DO storage after each mutating call ([`WasmBroker::snapshot`]) and
//! restores it on cold start ([`WasmBroker::from_snapshot`]). Per-connection
//! [`ConnState`] rides in the WebSocket attachment, round-tripped as JSON.
