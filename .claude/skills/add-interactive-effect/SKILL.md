# Adding an Interactive Effect

Interactive effects pause game resolution to wait for player input, then resume. Examples: Scry (choose top/bottom), Dig (choose cards to keep), Surveil (choose graveyard/library), Search (choose from library), Reveal+Choose (pick opponent's card).

The core mechanism is the **continuation pattern**: `resolve_ability_chain()` detects a waiting state, stashes remaining sub-abilities in `pending_continuation`, and returns. When the player responds, `engine.rs` resumes the chain.

**Before you start:** Trace Scry end-to-end as the simplest example:
- Resolver: `effects/scry.rs` — sets `WaitingFor::ScryChoice`
- Engine handler: `engine.rs` — `(WaitingFor::ScryChoice, GameAction::SelectCards)` arm
- Continuation: `pending_continuation` resumed after player selects
- AI: `legal_actions.rs` — generates legal card selections
- Frontend: `CardChoiceModal` → `ScryModal`

> **CR Verification Rule:** Every CR number in annotations MUST be verified by grepping `docs/MagicCompRules.txt` before writing. Do NOT rely on memory — 701.x and 702.x numbers are arbitrary sequential assignments that LLMs consistently hallucinate. Run `grep -n "^701.22" docs/MagicCompRules.txt` (etc.) for every number. If you cannot find it, do not write the annotation.

## The Continuation Pattern

This is the most important architectural concept for interactive effects.

### Problem

A card says "Scry 2, then draw a card." This is parsed as `Scry { count: 2 }` with `sub_ability: Draw { count: 1 }`. But Scry requires player input — the engine can't just barrel through to Draw.

### Solution: `pending_continuation`

```
resolve_ability_chain(ability) called:
    ↓
resolve_effect(Scry) → sets state.waiting_for = ScryChoice
    ↓
resolve_ability_chain detects waiting state:
    Has sub_ability (Draw)?
        YES → store as state.pending_continuation
        Return Ok(()) — chain paused
    ↓
[Player makes scry selection via GameAction::SelectCards]
    ↓
engine.rs handler processes the selection
    ↓
Check state.pending_continuation.take():
    Some(continuation) → resolve_ability_chain(continuation)
    None → return to Priority
```

### Key code: `resolve_ability_chain()` — `crates/engine/src/game/effects/mod.rs`

```rust
// After resolve_effect() returns, check if we entered a waiting state
if matches!(state.waiting_for,
    WaitingFor::ScryChoice { .. }
    | WaitingFor::DigChoice { .. }
    | WaitingFor::SurveilChoice { .. }
    | WaitingFor::RevealChoice { .. }
    | WaitingFor::SearchChoice { .. }
    | WaitingFor::DiscoverChoice { .. }
    | WaitingFor::TriggerTargetSelection { .. }
    | WaitingFor::NamedChoice { .. }
    // ← ADD YOUR NEW VARIANT HERE
) {
    // Stash remaining chain as continuation
    let mut sub_clone = sub.as_ref().clone();
    if sub_clone.targets.is_empty() && !ability.targets.is_empty() {
        sub_clone.targets = ability.targets.clone();  // propagate parent targets
    }
    state.pending_continuation = Some(Box::new(sub_clone));
    return Ok(());
}
```

**If you skip adding your variant to this match, sub-abilities after your interactive effect will execute immediately, bypassing the player choice entirely. This is the #1 source of bugs for interactive effects.**

### `pending_continuation` storage — `crates/engine/src/types/game_state.rs`

```rust
pub pending_continuation: Option<PendingContinuation>,

pub struct PendingContinuation {
    pub chain: Box<ResolvedAbility>,
    pub parent_kind: Option<EffectKind>, // used to re-emit parent EffectResolved on drain
}
```

The `parent_kind` field is set when the continuation is stashed so that draining the continuation re-emits the parent `EffectResolved` event (see commit `e69173e2f` — required for fight / `DamageAll` / `DamageEachPlayer` paths that pause mid-delivery).

### Target propagation

When the continuation is created, parent targets propagate down if the sub-ability has no targets of its own. This allows chains like "Exile target creature. Its controller gains life equal to its power" to work — the sub-ability receives the creature target from the parent.

## Checklist — Adding a New Interactive Effect

### Phase 1 — WaitingFor + GameAction

- [ ] **`crates/engine/src/types/game_state.rs` — `WaitingFor` enum**
  Add a variant carrying enough data for the frontend to render the choice UI:
  ```rust
  YourChoice {
      player: PlayerId,
      // Data the frontend needs to display options:
      cards: Vec<ObjectId>,     // if choosing cards
      options: Vec<String>,     // if choosing from named options
      // etc.
  },
  ```
  The `player` field is required — it determines who must act.

- [ ] **`crates/engine/src/types/actions.rs` — `GameAction` enum**
  Add a variant for the player's response. Reuse `SelectCards` or `SelectTargets` if they fit. Only create a new variant if the response shape is genuinely different:
  ```rust
  YourResponse {
      selection: YourSelectionType,
  },
  ```

### Phase 2 — Effect Resolver

- [ ] **`crates/engine/src/game/effects/<name>.rs` — resolver**
  The resolver does three things:
  1. Compute the choices available to the player
  2. Set `state.waiting_for = WaitingFor::YourChoice { ... }`
  3. Emit `GameEvent::EffectResolved`

  Pattern (from `effects/scry.rs`):
  ```rust
  pub fn resolve(state: &mut GameState, ability: &ResolvedAbility, events: &mut Vec<GameEvent>) -> Result<(), EffectError> {
      let player = ability.controller;
      // 1. Compute choices
      let cards = /* ... */;
      // 2. Set waiting state
      state.waiting_for = WaitingFor::YourChoice { player, cards };
      // 3. Emit event
      events.push(GameEvent::EffectResolved { kind: EffectKind::from(&*ability.effect), source_id: ability.source_id });
      Ok(())
  }
  ```

- [ ] **`crates/engine/src/game/effects/mod.rs` — wire resolver + continuation match**
  Two changes:
  1. Add `Effect::YourEffect { .. } => your_module::resolve(state, ability, events)` to `resolve_effect()`
  2. **Add `WaitingFor::YourChoice { .. }` to the continuation match in `resolve_ability_chain()`** — this is critical

### Phase 3 — Engine Handler

- [ ] **`crates/engine/src/game/engine.rs` — `apply()` match arm**
  Add a `(WaitingFor::YourChoice { .. }, GameAction::YourResponse { .. })` arm:

  ```rust
  (WaitingFor::YourChoice { player, cards, .. }, GameAction::YourResponse { selection }) => {
      // 1. Validate the response
      // 2. Apply the choice to game state
      // 3. Resume continuation if present:
      if let Some(continuation) = state.pending_continuation.take() {
          // Optionally inject the chosen card/target into continuation's targets:
          // continuation.targets = vec![TargetRef::Object(chosen_id)];
          effects::resolve_ability_chain(state, &continuation, &mut events, 0)
              .map_err(|e| EngineError::InvalidAction(format!("{:?}", e)))?;
      }
      // 4. Return next waiting state (usually Priority, unless continuation set a new one)
      if !matches!(state.waiting_for, WaitingFor::Priority { .. }) {
          state.waiting_for.clone()
      } else {
          WaitingFor::Priority { player: state.active_player }
      }
  }
  ```

  **Key detail**: After resuming the continuation, check `state.waiting_for` — the continuation might have entered another interactive state (chained choices).

### Phase 4 — AI Legal Actions

- [ ] **`crates/engine/src/ai_support/candidates.rs` — candidate action generation**
  Legal action generation now lives in the engine crate (`engine::ai_support`), not in `phase-ai`. The entry point is `engine::ai_support::legal_actions(state)` which calls `candidate_actions()`. Add a match arm generating all legal responses for your `WaitingFor` variant:

  ```rust
  WaitingFor::YourChoice { cards, .. } => {
      // Generate all valid selections the AI could make
      cards.iter().map(|&id| GameAction::YourResponse { selection: id }).collect()
  }
  ```

  Consider:
  - Are all combinations valid, or only specific ones?
  - Is there a "decline" / "choose nothing" option?
  - For large choice sets, does the AI need a subset? (e.g., SearchChoice limits to first N)

### Phase 5 — Multiplayer Routing

- [ ] **`crates/server-core/src/session.rs` — `acting_player()`**
  Add a match arm extracting the `player` field from your `WaitingFor` variant:

  ```rust
  WaitingFor::YourChoice { player, .. } => Some(*player),
  ```

  This ensures the server only accepts actions from the correct player.

### Phase 6 — Frontend

- [ ] **`client/src/adapter/types.ts` — `WaitingFor` + `GameAction` types**
  Add TypeScript discriminated union variants. `tsify` may auto-generate these from Rust — check `client/src/wasm/` for generated types and whether manual overrides exist in `types.ts`.

- [ ] **`client/src/pages/GamePage.tsx` or `client/src/components/` — UI component**
  Render the choice when `waitingFor.type === "YourChoice"`. Follow existing patterns:
  - `CardChoiceModal` → `ScryModal` — card reordering (top/bottom)
  - `CardChoiceModal` → `DigModal` — card selection (keep N)
  - `CardChoiceModal` → `SurveilModal` — binary per-card choice (library/graveyard)
  - `ChoiceModal` — simple option selection (buttons)
  - `CardChoiceModal` → `SearchModal` — filtered card selection from list
  - `NamedChoiceModal` — named choices including `CardName`, `NumberRange`, `Labeled`, and `LandType`

### Phase 7 — Multiplayer State Filtering (if hidden info)

- [ ] **`crates/server-core/src/filter.rs` — `filter_state_for_player()`**
  If your interactive effect reveals hidden information (opponent's hand, library cards, face-down cards):
  1. Track revealed cards via `state.revealed_cards` during the choice
  2. Clear revealed status after the choice is made
  3. Ensure `filter_state_for_player()` respects the revealed set

### Phase 8 — Tests

- [ ] Resolver test: effect sets correct `WaitingFor` with expected choices
- [ ] Engine round-trip test: set up waiting state → submit action → verify state change
- [ ] Continuation test: effect with sub_ability → interactive pause → resume → sub_ability executes
- [ ] AI test: `get_legal_actions()` returns valid options for the waiting state
- [ ] Verify per CLAUDE.md § "Canonical verification pattern" — `cargo fmt --all`, then if `tilt get uiresource clippy >/dev/null 2>&1`: `./scripts/tilt-wait.sh --timeout 240 clippy test-engine card-data`; else: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo test -p engine` + `./scripts/gen-card-data.sh`.

## Extending ChoiceType (Named Choice System)

The `NamedChoice` system is a well-contained interactive pattern with low blast radius for adding new choice types. Current `ChoiceType` variants: `CreatureType`, `Color`, `OddOrEven`, `BasicLandType`, `CardType`, `CardName`, `NumberRange { min, max }`, `Labeled { options }`, `LandType`, `Opponent`, `Player`, `TwoColors`.

### Architecture (all touchpoints)

| # | File | What to change |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | `crates/engine/src/types/ability.rs` — `ChoiceType` enum | Add variant with typed fields |
| 2 | `crates/engine/src/game/effects/choose.rs` — `compute_options()` | Add match arm to generate options for the new variant |
| 3 | `crates/engine/src/game/engine.rs` — `ChooseOption` handler | May need custom validation (e.g., NumberRange validates parsed u8 in range) |
| 4 | `client/src/adapter/types.ts` | Already generic (`choice_type: string`, `options: string[]`) — **no change needed** |
| 5 | `client/src/components/modal/NamedChoiceModal.tsx` | Add rendering branch only if the existing button grid / card-name search is insufficient |
| 6 | `client/src/components/modal/NamedChoiceModal.tsx` — `CHOICE_TYPE_LABELS` | Add user-facing label for the new type |
| 7 | `crates/engine/src/ai_support/candidates.rs` — `NamedChoice` arm | Already generates one action per option — works for any choice type with populated options |
| 8 | `crates/engine/src/parser/oracle_effect/` | Add parser patterns for the new choice text |
| 9 | `crates/engine/src/game/effects/choose.rs` — tests | Add test for `compute_options()` with new variant |

### Key design decisions

- **`last_named_choice: Option<String>`** stores the result for continuations. For `NumberRange`, the stored string is the number as text (e.g., `"3"`). Continuations parse it as needed. This avoids changing the continuation protocol.
- **Frontend `options: Vec<String>`** — for `NumberRange`, `compute_options()` generates `["0", "1", "2", ..., "7"]`. The current `ButtonGrid` renderer already works; a dedicated number input is optional UX polish, not required.
- **`Labeled { options }` carries its options in the enum variant** — unlike `Color` or `CreatureType` where options are hardcoded in `compute_options()`, `Labeled` options come from the parser (card-specific text like "fame" / "fortune").
- **Multiplayer filtering**: No changes needed — `NamedChoice` is public information, not filtered by `filter_state_for_player()`.
- **`source_id` / `persist`**: Existing mechanism for storing choice on the source object via `ChosenAttribute`. New choice types may not need persistence — use `persist: false` unless the choice must be remembered across turns.

---

## Interactive Replacement Effects

When a replacement effect (not a regular effect) needs player input, the pattern is different because the choice must happen **before the zone change** (see `add-replacement-effect` skill, Interactive Replacements section).

The key difference:
- **Regular interactive effect**: resolver sets WaitingFor, engine handler resumes via continuation
- **Interactive replacement**: the replacement pipeline pauses, stores the pending `ProposedEvent`, waits for choice, then executes the zone change with the choice applied

For interactive replacements, you need to:
1. Add WaitingFor + GameAction as above
2. Instead of an effect resolver, modify the replacement pipeline in `replacement.rs` to detect and pause
3. In `engine.rs`, handle the response by applying the choice, then resuming the stored zone change
4. This is more complex — see `add-replacement-effect` skill for the full pattern

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Missing continuation match in `resolve_ability_chain()`** | Sub-abilities after your effect execute immediately, bypassing player choice | Add your `WaitingFor` variant to the match block in `effects/mod.rs` |
| Missing `acting_player()` arm in `session.rs` | Server rejects all actions for this state in multiplayer | Add the match arm |
| Missing AI legal actions | AI hangs forever waiting for a response it can't generate | Add match arm in `engine/src/ai_support/candidates.rs` |
| Not clearing revealed state after choice | Opponent's hidden cards remain visible permanently | Clear `state.revealed_cards` in the engine handler |
| Resuming continuation without checking `state.waiting_for` | Continuation might set another interactive state, but you overwrite it with Priority | Check waiting_for after `resolve_ability_chain` returns |
| Not propagating targets to continuation | Sub-ability can't reference the chosen card | Copy parent targets when `sub_clone.targets.is_empty()` |
| Creating new `GameAction` when `SelectCards` works | Unnecessary type proliferation | Reuse `SelectCards` unless response shape is genuinely different |
