description: Use when shipping local commits to main via the merge queue. Creates an isolated worktree based on origin/main, cherry-picks the named commits into a fresh branch, pushes with --no-verify, opens a PR with `gh pr create --fill`, and enqueues with `gh pr merge --squash --auto`. Outbound counterpart to `pr-contribution-handler`. Use when the user says "ship this", "push to main", "send through the queue", "PR this work", or has finished a chunk of work and wants it on main.

# Ship Commits

Take local commits and land them on `main` through the merge queue, using an isolated worktree to avoid carrying other agents' concurrent work into the PR.

## Why a worktree

The main working dir is **assumed to contain other unrelated changes** from concurrent agents — unstaged work, other branches, in-progress commits on `main` that aren't yet shipped. Branching in place risks:

- Carrying unrelated commits into the PR (if local `main` is ahead of `origin/main` with multiple agents' work).
- Disturbing other agents' branch state with `git checkout` operations.
- Leaving the user on a topic branch they didn't expect to be on.

A worktree based on `origin/main` gives a clean branch we cherry-pick into, isolated from everything else.

## When to use

- User has finished a discrete chunk of work and wants it shipped.
- One or more commits exist locally (named explicitly, or "the last N commits on main", or "this commit").
- Goal: branch → push → PR → enqueue, with the queue handling rebase + CI + merge in the background.

## When NOT to use

- Work is uncommitted. Run `/commit` first (commit by pathspec — your memory's `feedback_shared_index_commit_pathspec`).
- A PR for these commits already exists. Use `gh pr merge <N> --auto` directly to enqueue.
- The commits are already on `origin/main`. Nothing to do.
- Repo isn't `phase-rs/phase`. This skill encodes phase.rs-specific conventions.

## Phase.rs-specific conventions

| Convention | Why |
|------------|-----|
| **Squash-only merges.** `--squash` is mandatory; `--merge` and `--rebase` are server-disabled. | Repo keeps `main` as one-commit-per-feature. |
| **`--auto` is mandatory on `gh pr merge`.** | Without it, the merge bypasses the queue and tries to merge immediately — fails on protected `main`. |
| **`--no-verify` on push.** | Pre-push hooks duplicate validation that Tilt/CI has already done locally. CI/queue will re-validate. |
| **Branch protection on `main` blocks direct push for non-admins.** | Queue handles serialization for parallel PRs. |
| **Worktree-based shipping.** | Main working dir has concurrent changes from other agents — don't disturb them. |

## Sequence

### 0. Reconcile already-shipped commits (run this FIRST)

**Squash-merges leave the originals stranded on local `main`.** When a prior ship's PR squash-merges, its commits collapse into one *new* commit on `origin/main` with a different SHA and patch-id. The original commits still sit on local `main`, invisible to any SHA- or `git cherry` patch-id comparison. Left alone they pile up across sessions and — worse — get **re-shipped**, because Step 1's `git rev-list origin/main..main` re-lists them. Clear them before doing anything else.

The safe, squash-aware test is content-based: a 3-way merge of local `main` into `origin/main` that yields `origin/main`'s *exact tree* means local `main` contributes no new content, so every ahead-commit is already shipped and resetting loses nothing.

```bash
git fetch origin main
ahead=$(git rev-list --count origin/main..main)
if [ "$ahead" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "local main not ahead of origin/main — nothing to reconcile"
else
  merged_tree=$(git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main main 2>/dev/null); mt_exit=$?
  origin_tree=$(git rev-parse 'origin/main^{tree}')
  if [ "$mt_exit" -eq 0 ] && [ "$merged_tree" = "$origin_tree" ]; then
    # Every ahead-commit's content is already in origin/main (incl. via squash).
    # Multi-agent guard: never discard another agent's uncommitted tracked work.
    # (reset --hard preserves untracked files; it only drops tracked modifications.)
    if git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet; then
      git reset --hard origin/main
      echo "reset local main to origin/main — dropped $ahead already-shipped commit(s)"
    else
      echo "WARNING: $ahead ahead-commit(s) are already shipped, but the working tree has"
      echo "uncommitted tracked changes — NOT resetting. Resolve those first, then re-run."
    fi
  else
    # merge-tree conflicted, OR local main adds content origin/main lacks.
    echo "local main has $ahead ahead-commit(s) NOT fully contained in origin/main:"
    git --no-pager log --oneline origin/main..main
    echo "(genuine unshipped work, or a PR that diverged from local main during review.)"
  fi
fi
```

Outcomes:
- **Reset happened** → re-evaluate what (if anything) is actually left to ship before continuing.
- **Left alone, clean (`mt_exit` 0 but tree differs)** → there is genuine unshipped work; proceed to Step 1 to ship it.
- **Left alone, divergent (`mt_exit` non-zero)** → the ahead-commits look shipped but the merged PR diverged from local `main` (e.g., a fix was added during review, as happens when a cherry-pick onto a newer `origin/main` needed a follow-up). The clean fix is still `git reset --hard origin/main` once nothing local is worth keeping — **surface this to the user and let them decide; do not silently discard.**

**Then prune ship worktrees whose PR has merged.** Each ship leaves a `../forge.rs-ship-*` worktree on a `ship/<topic>` branch (Step 8). After the PR squash-merges, that worktree is dead weight and its build artifacts (`target/`, `node_modules/`) pile up on disk. Remove the ones whose branch is now fully contained in `origin/main`:

```bash
git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{wt=$2} /^branch /{print wt"\t"$2}' \
| while IFS=$'\t' read -r wt ref; do
    case "$ref" in refs/heads/ship/*) ;; *) continue ;; esac        # only OUR ship/* worktrees — never another agent's
    br=${ref#refs/heads/}
    merged=$(git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main "$br" 2>/dev/null)
    [ "$merged" = "$(git rev-parse 'origin/main^{tree}')" ] || continue   # not yet merged (PR still in queue) — keep
    if git -C "$wt" diff --quiet && git -C "$wt" diff --cached --quiet; then
      # merged + no tracked changes → only gitignored build output remains, so --force is safe
      git worktree remove --force "$wt" && git branch -D "$br" \
        && echo "pruned merged ship worktree $wt ($br)"
    else
      echo "ship worktree $wt ($br) is merged but has uncommitted TRACKED changes — leaving it for review"
    fi
  done
git worktree prune    # drop stale admin refs for worktrees whose dir was deleted manually
```

This only ever touches `ship/*` worktrees this skill created; `forge.rs-pr` and `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` are filtered out. `--force` is deliberate — a merged ship worktree's sole uncommitted content is gitignored build output (`target/`/`node_modules/`), and the tracked-diff guard refuses if anything real is dirty.

### 1. Identify the commits to ship

If the user named commits explicitly (SHAs, "the last commit", "HEAD~3..HEAD"), use them. Otherwise, ask once: which commits?

Resolve to a concrete list of SHAs in chronological order (oldest first):

```bash
# Examples — pick the one that matches the user's intent:
git rev-list --reverse origin/main..HEAD            # all commits on current branch ahead of origin/main
git rev-list --reverse origin/main..main            # all commits on local main ahead of origin/main
git rev-list --reverse <BASE>..<TIP>                # explicit range
echo <SHA1> <SHA2>                                  # specific SHAs (already in order)
```

Capture as a space-separated list: `SHAS="abc123 def456 ..."`. Verify they exist:

```bash
for sha in $SHAS; do git cat-file -e "$sha" || { echo "missing: $sha"; exit 1; }; done
```

### 2. Derive branch name + worktree path

Use the first commit's subject (or user-provided topic) for both, kebab-case, no timestamps:

```bash
TOPIC=$(git log -1 --format=%s "$(echo $SHAS | awk '{print $1}')" | head -c 50 | tr -cd 'a-zA-Z0-9 -' | tr ' ' '-' | tr -s '-' | sed 's/-$//')
BRANCH="ship/$TOPIC"
WORKTREE="../forge.rs-ship-$TOPIC"
```

If the branch already exists locally or remotely, append `-2`, `-3`, etc. Don't reuse an existing branch — that complicates the cherry-pick path.

### 3. Create the worktree

```bash
git fetch origin main
git worktree add "$WORKTREE" -b "$BRANCH" origin/main
cd "$WORKTREE"
```

The worktree starts at `origin/main` HEAD with a fresh branch checked out. No working-tree contamination from the main dir.

### 4. Cherry-pick the commits

```bash
git cherry-pick $SHAS
```

If a cherry-pick fails with a conflict, do NOT auto-resolve — abort and surface to the user:

```bash
# On conflict:
git cherry-pick --abort
cd -
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE"
# Report: "Cherry-pick of <SHA> failed with conflicts against origin/main.
#         The commit assumes state that isn't in origin/main yet — likely
#         depends on another unshipped commit. Either ship the dependency
#         first or rebase manually."
```

Conflicts almost always mean a missing dependency commit, which the user needs to resolve manually.

### 5. Push and open PR

```bash
git push --no-verify -u origin "$BRANCH"
gh pr create --fill
```

`--no-verify` skips pre-push hooks (Tilt already validated; CI re-validates). `--fill` populates title/body from commit messages.

Capture the PR number from `gh pr create` output for the next step.

### 6. Enqueue

```bash
gh pr merge "$PR_NUMBER" --auto
```

Do NOT wait — the queue is async. Move on.

If `gh pr merge` errors:

- `not in mergeable state` → CI hasn't reported yet. Wait 10s, retry once. If still failing, surface to user.
- `auto-merge is not allowed` / `merge queue not enabled` → repo setting drift; surface to user.
- Auth errors → surface to user.

Never retry blindly.

### 7. Reconcile local main (post-ship)

Re-run the **Step 0 reconciliation** (`cd -` back to the main working dir first). Immediately after enqueue the PR hasn't merged, so `origin/main` hasn't advanced and the merge-tree test shows `main` still ahead — it correctly **no-ops**, leaving the just-shipped commits in place until the queue lands them. The durable cleanup then happens automatically on the *next* ship-commits run (Step 0), once the PR has squash-merged.

Do **not** reintroduce a SHA-equality reset here. A squash-merge changes the SHA, so `git rev-list origin/main..main == $SHAS` never matches after merge and the commits accumulate forever — that is the exact bug Step 0's content-based test fixes.

If the commits were shipped from a feature branch (not `main`), leave that branch alone.

### 8. Worktree disposition

Default: leave the worktree at `$WORKTREE` so the user can inspect it if the queue rejects the PR. It's gitignored at the repo level (worktrees live above the repo root). It will be **auto-pruned by Step 0 on the next ship-commits run** once its PR squash-merges (along with its build artifacts) — so you don't have to remember to clean it up. To remove it sooner: `git worktree remove "$WORKTREE"` once the PR lands.

If the user explicitly asks for clean-up-as-you-go, remove immediately after enqueue:

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE"
```

## Multi-commit batch ship

When the user has several independent chunks to ship in parallel:

1. For each chunk: do steps 2–6 in its own worktree (each branched from `origin/main`, not from a previous chunk's branch).
2. Fire all enqueues without waiting between them — the queue batches up to its configured group size and runs CI once on the synthesized group.
3. Step 7 (reconcile local main) runs once at the end; it is content-based (see Step 0) and no-ops until the PRs squash-merge, so it never needs to know which commits belonged to which chunk.
4. Report each PR + enqueue status in one final summary.

Branching each chunk off `origin/main` (not stacked) avoids dependency chains where one PR's failure blocks the others.

## Final report

For each shipped PR, report:

- PR number + URL
- Branch name + worktree path
- Commits included (SHA + subject, in cherry-pick order)
- Enqueue status: `enqueued: yes` with timestamp, or `enqueued: no` with the exact `gh pr merge` error
- Whether local `main` was reset (and why, or why not)
- Worktree disposition (left in place vs. removed)

Do not claim "merged" — the queue is async. The correct status at end-of-skill is `enqueued`.
