//! `RedundancyAvoidancePolicy` — cross-cutting tactical signal that
//! penalises activated abilities and spell casts whose effects produce
//! already-active game state.
//!
//! Motivation. Prior to this policy, the AI's softmax treated "discard for
//! redundant effect" and "pump-already-pumped" activations as net-positive
//! because the discard cost was being refunded elsewhere (e.g., Monument to
//! Endurance replaces the discarded card) and the ability itself scored
//! weakly positive. The defence-in-depth per-source activation cap
//! (`MAX_ACTIVATIONS_PER_SOURCE_PER_TURN`) bounds the runaway, but the AI
//! still burns cycles searching loops whose gain is nil. This policy makes
//! the scoring honest by detecting the redundant-outcome shape and emitting
//! a typed negative `delta`.
//!
//! Design.
//! - The policy fires on `CastSpell` and `ActivateAbility`.
//! - `verdict()` walks the candidate's effect chain via `ctx.effects()`,
//!   dispatches per `Effect` variant in an exhaustive `match`, and sums the
//!   redundancy contribution from each arm.
//! - Exhaustiveness is the coverage tracker: new `Effect` variants force
//!   a compile-time decision about whether they admit a redundancy check.
//!
//! Shipped predicates (see `redundancy_delta` arms):
//! - `Tap` — every candidate target is already tapped.
//! - `Untap` — every candidate target is already untapped.
//! - `Pump` — every candidate target already has an active
//!   `UntilEndOfTurn` pump from this same source with matching P/T.
//! - `GainLife` — controller's life ≥ `LIFE_DIMINISHING_RETURNS`.
//! - `DealDamage` / `Draw` / `AddCounter` — the `QuantityExpr` (`amount`/
//!   `count`) resolves to 0, so the effect is a strict no-op.
//! - `GenericEffect` granting a keyword — every candidate target already
//!   has that keyword effectively.
//! - `Animate` granting keywords — every candidate target already has all
//!   granted keywords.
//!
//! TODOs for follow-up shipments (exhaustive-match arms intentionally
//! return `None` for these categories today):
//! - `AddCounter` — the strictly-redundant zero-count sub-case ships above
//!   (count `QuantityExpr` resolves to 0). The broader case — accumulating
//!   +1/+1 counters is almost always beneficial — is still deferred; it would
//!   need a deeper "counter-doubling payoff absent" check before penalising a
//!   nonzero grant.
//! - `Discard` — penalise "opponent discards" when opponent's hand is
//!   known-empty (requires information-asymmetry handling).
//! - Multi-turn projection (draw into a full hand when discard is coming).
//!
//! Deferred (issue #563 — Whitemane Lion ETB self-bounce loop):
//! - **Per-turn cast cap (defence-in-depth)**: `MAX_ACTIVATIONS_PER_SOURCE_PER_TURN`
//!   today only bounds `ActivateAbility`. Mirroring it as a
//!   `spells_cast_this_turn_by_player[card_id]` cap would catch any future
//!   loop class that slips past content-level redundancy detection, including
//!   non-bounce self-undoing patterns. Tracked separately; not implemented here.
//! - **Parser non-targeting fix**: Whitemane Lion's ETB ("return a creature
//!   you control to its owner's hand") is non-targeting in Oracle terms,
//!   but currently parses as a targeted Bounce. Fixing the parser would make
//!   the AI choose correctly at resolution time without needing this policy
//!   to short-circuit casts. Tracked separately as an oracle-parser issue.
