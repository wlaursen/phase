//! Ability cost payment authority (L2).
//!
//! This module is the single authority that executes payment of an ability's
//! cost (CLAUDE.md: "Single authority for ability costs"). It owns the only
//! `match` over `AbilityCost` that mutates player/object state to pay a cost,
//! plus the CR 616.1 replacement-pause bookkeeping. Both activation-time
//! (CR 601.2g/h) and resolution-time (CR 118.12) payment flow through it; the
//! caller selects the regime via [`PaymentScope`], which carries the genuine
//! scope differences (CR-confirmed in the unification plan §2): quantity
//! resolution context, mana payment context, and PayLife helper selection
//! (the activation helper additionally applies cast/activation life-payment
//! prohibition statics; plan R4 keeps such forks explicit in the arm).
//!
//! Originally extracted from `casting.rs` as a pure code-motion seam (Phase 1);
//! Phase 2 introduced [`PaymentScope`] and routed the resolution-time
//! `Effect::PayCost` arms (`effects/pay.rs`) through this authority, deleting
//! their duplicate Mana/ManaDynamic/PayLife/PayEnergy/Composite/Discard
//! implementations. Phase 5 added [`can_pay`] — the single affordability
//! authority that composes `AbilityCost::is_payable` (the CR 118.3
//! resource/choice-eligibility gate) with a scope-appropriate check: the
//! relocated A2 clone-and-simulate for activation, the relocated A3 resource
//! match for resolution (`supported_at_resolution` is the shared membership
//! authority for which shapes have a resolution payment arm). The activation
//! flow, the `WaitingFor::PayCost` emission/resume handlers, the cost finder
//! helpers, and the mana planner all remain in `casting.rs`;
//! `casting::can_pay_ability_cost_now` now delegates to [`can_pay`].
//!
//! L1-primitives-only rule (TARGET invariant): code here pays costs through
//! L1 resource primitives (`life_costs`, `effects::counters`, `sacrifice`,
//! `effects::discard`, `zones`, `effects::attach`, and the mana payment path
//! in `casting.rs`) and must never re-implement resource math beyond a direct
//! L1 call. This rule binds the L3 resume handlers too: the
//! `WaitingFor::PayCost` / `WardDiscardChoice` / `WardSacrificeChoice` resume
//! handlers (in `engine.rs`/`engine_payment_choices.rs`) match on
//! `PayCostKind`/`WaitingFor` variants and may call L1 primitives
//! (`sacrifice_permanent`, `discard_as_cost`, …) to execute a player's concrete
//! selection, but they must never match on `AbilityCost` or re-implement the
//! resource math that lives here (risk R8). Known exceptions carried over
//! verbatim, to be collapsed in Phase 5: the `PayEnergy` arm hand-rolls the
//! energy decrement (pending a `players::pay_energy` L1 helper) and the `Tap`
//! arm sets `tapped` directly.
