//! CR 730 (Merging with Permanents) + CR 702.140 (Mutate).
//!
//! Phase 1 of the Mutate keyword. A mutating creature spell that resolves with a
//! legal target does NOT enter the battlefield (CR 702.140c); instead it merges
//! with the target creature, becoming one object represented by more than one
//! card or token (CR 730.2). This module owns the merge primitive
//! ([`merge_object_onto`]), the leave-the-battlefield split (CR 730.3,
//! [`split_merged_permanent_on_leave`]), and the top/bottom choice handler
//! ([`handle_mutate_merge_choice`]).
//!
//! Merge identity (BINDING review resolution S4):
//!   * The surviving battlefield object is ALWAYS the target creature's
//!     `ObjectId` (CR 730.2c continuity). The merged permanent "is the same
//!     object that it was before."
//!   * Over/under only selects which component supplies copiable characteristics
//!     (CR 730.2a) — recorded as the topmost element of
//!     `GameObject::merged_components` (convention: index `[0]` is topmost).
//!   * The merged permanent always has the UNION of every component's abilities
//!     (CR 702.140e); its other characteristics come from the topmost component
//!     (CR 730.2a).
//!   * Each component retains its ORIGINAL owner so the CR 730.3 leave-split
//!     routes each card/token to the correct player's zone.
//!
//! Multi-instance stacking (CR 730.2) IS supported: mutating onto an
//! already-merged permanent extends its component stack, and the merged
//! permanent's layer-1 copy effect is re-derived from the full stack each time.
//!
//! Deferred: copy effects targeting a merged permanent, face-down/DFC
//! components, full CR 702.140d downstream reflexive effects, and the CR 730.3a
//! graveyard/library arrange-order UI (a deterministic order is used).
