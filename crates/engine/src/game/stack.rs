// ── Tier 3: true batch-resolution of identical token-creating triggers ────
//
// `resolve_next` wraps `resolve_top`. When the top of the stack begins a
// contiguous run of provably-batch-safe identical triggered abilities, it
// resolves the whole run in one step that applies the effect N times — the
// same observable state and (coalesced) event sequence as one-by-one. Any
// uncertainty falls back to the unchanged `resolve_top`. Three layers gate
// eligibility: Layer A (run-identity, `BatchRunKey`), Layer B (handler purity,
// `effects::try_resolve_batch`), Layer C (observer-order-invariance,
// `observers_are_batch_safe`). See the plan trace in `effects/mod.rs`.

/// Sentinel object id used only to build Layer C probe events. `keys_from_event`
/// reads only `record.core_types`/`to` (ETB keys) and the `TokenCreated` variant
/// tag — never the `object_id` — so a sentinel is sound (§2.3 PROBE_ID note).
