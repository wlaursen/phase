//! CR 603.2 + CR 603.6a + CR 611.2e: `TriggerIndex` — battlefield-scoped
//! candidate pre-filter for `collect_pending_triggers`. Replaces a full
//! battlefield scan with an event-keyed lookup so trigger-firing cost scales
//! with the number of *relevant* triggers, not with `|battlefield|`.
//!
//! # Correctness model
//!
//! The index maps `TriggerEventKey` → `SmallVec<ObjectId>` ("which permanents
//! could match an event with this shape"). The consult site unions the
//! relevant buckets with `unclassified` and asks each candidate's per-trigger
//! matcher whether it actually matches — the matcher itself is unchanged.
//!
//! Two derivers maintain the index:
//!
//! - `keys_from_event(event, state)`: the keys an event hits at consult time.
//! - `keys_from_trigger_def(def)`: the keys a trigger definition registers
//!   into at maintain time.
//!
//! CR 603.2 over-approximation invariant: it is correctness-preserving to
//! emit more keys than strictly necessary at either site; it is a silent
//! trigger-drop bug to emit fewer. Both derivers are exhaustive `match`es
//! with NO `_` wildcard arms — adding a new `TriggerMode`, `GameEvent`, or
//! `EffectKind` variant is a compile error until the deriver classifies it.
//!
//! # Authority
//!
//! The authoritative correctness path is the rebuild at the end of
//! `evaluate_layers` (CR 611.2e): every continuous-effect-driven mutation of
//! `obj.trigger_definitions` (sliver lords, Changeling, Bramble Sovereign,
//! suppress-triggers statics) flows through the layer pipeline, and
//! `collect_pending_triggers` flushes pending layers before reading the index.
//! The `move_to_zone` incremental hooks are best-effort optimization between
//! layer flushes — they are NOT the safety net.
