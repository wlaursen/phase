    // Amulet of Vigor ("Whenever a permanent you control enters tapped, untap
    // it.") is an *observer* trigger: its `valid_card` matches any permanent the
    // controller owns, so the entering permanent differs from the ability
    // source. The `ZoneChangeObjectIsTapped` condition must read the entering
    // permanent named by the `ZoneChanged` event — NOT the (untapped) Amulet.

    // These tests drive the real pipeline: `resolve()` performs the ChangeZone
    // effect (tapping the entering permanent and emitting a real `ZoneChanged`
    // event), then `process_triggers` scans the battlefield for matching
    // observer triggers and stacks them. On pre-fix `main`, the buggy
    // `SourceIsTapped` condition reads the untapped Amulet → trigger never
    // fires → these tests fail.
