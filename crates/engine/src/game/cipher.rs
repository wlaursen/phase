//! Cipher (CR 702.99) — self-contained runtime for the keyword.
//!
//! Cipher is two abilities on an instant/sorcery:
//!
//! 1. **Spell ability (on resolution).** "If this spell is represented by a
//!    card, you may exile this card encoded on a creature you control"
//!    (CR 702.99a). Handled by [`offer_encode`] / [`finish_encode`]: the
//!    resolving spell pauses (mirroring Mutate's resolution pause), the
//!    controller picks one of their creatures (or declines), and on accept the
//!    card is exiled and an [`ExileLinkKind::Cipher`] link records the
//!    *encoded* relationship (CR 702.99b).
//!
//! 2. **Static ability (while the card is encoded).** "For as long as this card
//!    is encoded on that creature, that creature has 'Whenever this creature
//!    deals combat damage to a player, you may copy the encoded card and you
//!    may cast the copy without paying its mana cost'" (CR 702.99c). Handled by
//!    [`combat_damage_recast_triggers`]: when an encoded creature deals combat
//!    damage to a player, an optional [`Effect::CastCopyOfCard`] triggered
//!    ability is put on the stack, targeting the encoded card in exile.
//!
//! The encode relationship lives in `state.exile_links` and is pruned for free
//! by the existing `zones.rs` cleanup: the card leaving exile, or the creature
//! leaving the battlefield, drops the link — exactly CR 702.99c's lifetime. A
//! later cipher spell can re-encode onto the same creature (CR 702.99); each
//! encode is an independent link.
