//! Unified zone-change pipeline (Phase A carve-out).
//!
//! This module is the home of the single zone-change entry point. Phase A moves
//! the most-complete pipeline copy (`change_zone::execute_zone_move` and its
//! delivery tail) here verbatim, exposes the new request/cause types and the
//! `move_object` wrapper, and seeds the `ApprovedZoneChange` proof token used to
//! fence delivery in later phases. Existing callers continue to reach the moved
//! functions through `pub(crate) use` shims left at their old `change_zone.rs`
//! paths, so no behavior changes in this phase.
//!
//! Layer discipline (PLAN §2): `zones.rs` keeps every guard that must hold
//! unconditionally (CR 111.8 token guard, CR 614.1d ETB block, CR 400.7 cleanup,
//! `GameEvent::ZoneChanged` emission); this module owns the "would"-semantics
//! layer (CR 614.1 / 614.6 replacement consult, CR 616.1 choices, CR 614.1c
//! enters-with seeding) plus the CR 303.4f aura-host choice.
