//! Categorical freeze guard for the runtime `ObjectScope::Anaphoric` leak set.
//!
//! ## Background — issue #495 (Rite of Consumption)
//!
//! Issue #495 introduced `ObjectScope::Anaphoric` to disambiguate an anaphoric
//! "its" (a parse-time reference whose antecedent is a trigger source, a bound
//! trigger subject, or a spell's `Target`) from an explicit cost-paid
//! possessive ("the sacrificed creature's power"). Before `Anaphoric` existed,
//! the subject-injection rewrite in the effect parser would clobber a
//! correctly-scoped possessive, which is the root cause of Rite of Consumption
//! dealing no damage.
//!
//! After the #495 fix and the bare-anaphoric-possessive classifier fix (Yuriko,
//! the Tiger's Shadow / Dark Confidant class — `classify_possessive_referent`
//! in `parser/oracle_quantity.rs`), exactly **251** cards in the exported card
//! data retain a runtime `ObjectScope::Anaphoric` in a `DealDamage` /
//! `GainLife` / `LoseLife` (or similar) amount. This test holds that set as a
//! sorted constant and fails if a card leaks in or out of it — a tripwire,
//! not a snapshot.
//!
//! ## The four categories of retained `Anaphoric`
//!
//! 1. **Triggered-ability source anaphora** — e.g. *Conclave Mentor*. The "its"
//!    in the ability text refers to the trigger source `~` (the permanent with
//!    the triggered ability). This is correct: the antecedent genuinely is the
//!    source object, and `Anaphoric` resolves to it identically to how
//!    `CostPaidObject` would, so behavior is unchanged. This category is
//!    correctly parsed.
//!
//! 2. **Trigger-subject anaphora** — e.g. *Warstorm Surge* ("it deals damage
//!    equal to its power"). The "its" refers to the trigger's bound "it" (the
//!    creature that entered / attacked / etc.), not the trigger source. The
//!    parser currently scopes this to `Anaphoric` rather than the bound trigger
//!    subject. This is a *genuine pre-existing misparse* — it happens to
//!    resolve correctly today only because the source and the bound subject
//!    coincide for the common cases, but the scope is semantically wrong.
//!
//! 3. **Target-creature spell anaphora** — e.g. *Chandra's Ignition* ("...
//!    equal to its power", where "its" = the `Target` creature). The "its"
//!    refers to the spell's chosen `Target`, not a source or trigger subject.
//!    This is also a *genuine pre-existing misparse*: the referent should be
//!    the target slot, not an anaphoric source marker.
//!
//! 4. **Bare anaphoric possessive (CR 608.2c reveal/move/effect-sacrifice
//!    class — Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow / Dark Confidant / Mana Drain /
//!    Calibrated Blast / Reanimate / Vendetta / etc.)** — e.g. "...reveal
//!    the top card of your library... loses life equal to that card's mana
//!    value" or "counter target spell... add an amount of mana equal to
//!    that spell's mana value". The bare "that <type>" / "the <type>"
//!    possessive prefix anchors to the object introduced by an earlier
//!    instruction in the same ability. `classify_possessive_referent`
//!    selects `ObjectScope::Anaphoric` so the runtime consults
//!    `effect_context_object` first (CR 608.2c instruction-order referent)
//!    rather than the cost-paid object or the trigger source. The 88
//!    additions break down by anaphor source:
//!    - **reveal-then-act** (`RevealTop` → instruction reads "that card") —
//!      Yuriko, Dark Confidant (already category 4 by its pronoun form),
//!      Calibrated Blast, Erratic Explosion, Explosive Revelation, Riddle
//!      of Lightning, Sin Prodder, Pain Seer, Ruin Raider, etc.
//!    - **counter-then-act** (`Counter` → instruction reads "that spell") —
//!      Mana Drain (delayed mana refund), Overwhelming Intellect, Refuse,
//!      Scattering Stroke.
//!    - **effect-sacrifice-then-act** (sub-`Sacrifice` → instruction reads
//!      "that creature") — Twisted Justice, Tribute to Hunger, Devour
//!      Flesh, Vendetta, Devour in Shadow, Greven, Predator Captain.
//!    - **reanimate-then-act** (`ChangeZone` graveyard → battlefield, then
//!      reads "that creature") — Reanimate, Daxos of Meletis.
//!    - **mill/discover/explosion chains** with the same "earlier-effect
//!      object" anaphor shape.
//!
//!    This category went from misparsed (`CostPaidObject`, silently reading
//!    the trigger source — Yuriko's bug) to correct (`Anaphoric`, slot-1
//!    `effect_context_object` → revealed/moved/sacrificed object). Each
//!    subclass relies on the corresponding source in
//!    `parent_referent_context_from_events` (`game/effects/mod.rs:602`)
//!    being populated, and on `snapshot_quantity_ref`
//!    (`game/effects/delayed_trigger.rs:331`) including `Anaphoric` in its
//!    snapshot-baking match arm (added in lockstep with this categorization).
//!
//! ## Behavior-neutrality proof (categories 1-3) and intentional behavior
//! change (category 4)
//!
//! The original 156 entries (categories 1-3) parsed as `CostPaidObject`
//! *before* `ObjectScope::Anaphoric` existed — verifiable with
//! `git show <pre-#495>:crates/engine/src/parser/oracle_quantity.rs`. Issue
//! #495's runtime resolution arm (`game/quantity.rs`, `object_for_scope` /
//! `resolve_object_pt` / `resolve_object_mana_value`) resolved `Anaphoric`
//! *identically* to `CostPaidObject` at the time. Therefore #495 was a
//! behavior-preserving relabel for those 156, and a correctness fix for Rite.
//!
//! After Dark Confidant (#511) added the
//! `effect_context_object`-first slot priority to `Anaphoric`'s runtime arm
//! (see `resolve_object_mana_value`), the bare-anaphoric-possessive parser
//! fix (Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow) routes the category-4 cards (88 entries,
//! including Yuriko itself) onto that already-extended arm. For those
//! cards the change is an *intentional* behavior fix: the runtime now reads
//! the revealed / countered / moved object first, matching CR 608.2c. The
//! previous `CostPaidObject` parse silently fell through to the trigger
//! source (Yuriko's Ninja, the casting spell, etc.) and produced the wrong
//! amount.
//!
//! ## Why this guard exists
//!
//! Categories 2 and 3 are genuine parser misparses. They are pre-existing
//! (not introduced by #495) and are tracked separately:
//!
//! - **#512** — categories 2 & 3: scope trigger-subject / target-creature
//!   anaphora to the correct referent instead of `Anaphoric`.
//! - **#511** — the bare-pronoun reveal-referent variant (*Dark Confidant*
//!   — "its mana value", where "its" = the revealed card).
//!
//! Category 4 is the explicit-possessive sibling of #511 — same antecedent
//! shape, just with an explicit type word ("that card's mana value") instead
//! of the pronoun ("its mana value"). Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow surfaced the
//! same bug as Dark Confidant once #511 fixed the pronoun branch.
//!
//! This test **freezes** the `Anaphoric` set so it cannot grow silently while
//! #512 does the remaining category-2/3 fixes. A new leak (a new card name,
//! or a count change) fails this test; a human then decides whether it is a
//! legitimate new category-1/2/3/4 case (add it here) or a real regression
//! (fix the parser). The curation lives at the *category* level — the
//! correct granularity — not as 251 per-card annotations.
