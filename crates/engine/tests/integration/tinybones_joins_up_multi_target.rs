//! Integration test for GitHub issue #426 — Tinybones Joins Up's ETB trigger
//! "any number of target players each discard a card".
//!
//! The ETB trigger parses correctly to `Discard { count: 1, target: Player }`
//! with `multi_target: { min: 0, max: null }` — an all-optional multi-target
//! set over `TargetFilter::Player`. The reported symptom was that the targeting
//! UI never surfaced and the targeted players were skipped.
//!
//! This file is the regression deliverable: it drives the REAL `apply`
//! pipeline in a 3-player game — cast Tinybones Joins Up → resolve → ETB fires
//! through `process_triggers` → `WaitingFor::TriggerTargetSelection` over the 3
//! players → `SelectTargets`/`ChooseTarget` → discards resolve. No synthetic
//! `pending_trigger`, no hand-rolled `WaitingFor`.
//!
//! Pinned `WaitingFor` variant: the triggered-ability target path constructs
//! `WaitingFor::TriggerTargetSelection` (`engine::game::engine::
//! begin_pending_trigger_target_selection`). `MultiTargetSelection` is the
//! spell-cast path and is NOT used here.
//!
//! CR 603.3d: "The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on
//! the stack is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules
//! 601.2c-d." — the trigger's controller chooses its targets as it goes on the
//! stack.
//! CR 601.2c: "If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player
//! announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those
//! targets." — "any number of target players" permits choosing 0+ players.
