//! Integration tests for The Chain Veil (Commander 2014).
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!   At the beginning of your end step, if you didn't activate a loyalty
//!   ability of a planeswalker this turn, you lose 2 life.
//!   {4}, {T}: For each planeswalker you control, you may activate one of
//!   its loyalty abilities once this turn as though none of its loyalty
//!   abilities have been activated this turn.
//!
//! These tests pin the end-to-end mechanics layered on top of the new
//! infrastructure:
//!   - `GameState::loyalty_abilities_activated_this_turn` — per-player
//!     activation history, read by `QuantityRef::LoyaltyAbilitiesActivatedThisTurn`.
//!   - `GameState::extra_loyalty_activations_this_turn` — per-player grant
//!     budget, written by `Effect::GrantExtraLoyaltyActivations` and consumed
//!     by `planeswalker::can_activate_loyalty_ability`.
//!   - `GameObject::loyalty_activations_this_turn` — per-planeswalker counter
//!     (migrated from the old `loyalty_activated_this_turn: bool`).
//!
//! Parser tests covering The Chain Veil's Oracle text dispatch live in the
//! corresponding parser unit modules; these tests focus on the resolution and
//! activation-gate behavior.
