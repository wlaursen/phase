//! God-Pharaoh's Gift (#2350) — a second same-turn resolution must copy the
//! creature THIS resolution exiled, not the one a prior same-turn resolution
//! exiled.
//!
//! Oracle (the relevant triggered ability): "you may exile a creature card from
//! your graveyard. If you do, create a token that's a copy of that card, except
//! it's a 4/4 black Zombie ... with haste."
//!
//! The "If you do, create a token that's a copy of that card" rider is a
//! tracked-set CONSUMER: `CopyTokenOf { target: TrackedSet }` whose "that card"
//! anaphor (CR 707.2a — a copy acquires the copiable values of the object it's
//! copying) names the very card the gating exile published into the chain's
//! tracked set during THIS resolution.
//!
//! CR 608.2c / CR 603.7: the rider resolves in the same instruction chain as
//! the gating exile, so "that card" must bind to the chain-local
//! `chain_tracked_set_id`, not the turn-global fallback.
//!
//! Pre-fix bug: the "If you do" boundary unconditionally reset
//! `chain_tracked_set_id = None` (added for Party Thrasher's PRODUCER rider,
//! #1977). That orphaned GPG's consumer rider to the turn-global
//! `latest_tracked_set_id` fallback. When GPG resolved twice in one turn, both
//! exiled cards' tracked sets persisted, so the second resolution's copy bound
//! to the FIRST resolution's exiled card — copying the wrong creature.
//!
//! The fix gates the reset behind `!effect_references_tracked_set(&sub.effect)`:
//! consumer riders (GPG) keep the chain-local set; producer riders (Party
//! Thrasher's `ExileTop`) still get the reset. This test fails on revert: the
//! second token would copy "Grizzly Bears" instead of "Walking Corpse".
